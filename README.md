Advance Python Training - Capstone Project movie suggestion app:

• We used the requests library to fetch HTML content from IMDb for a given genre.
• Beautiful Soup is used to parse the HTML content and extract movie titles.
• The first function is used to scrape movie titles based on the provided genre.
• The seconf function is used to save all the scraped data in dataframe and csv file.
• The third function provides a random movie recommendation based on the genre.
• We create a simple text-based interface for user interaction.
• Finally, the functions are called.
• Exceptions are used to handle error and to make sure the app runs smoothly.
• When code is run, User must provide genre and according to that a movie will be suggested. User can continue to ask for suggestion or end once the suggestion is recived by providing input 'y' or 'n'.
